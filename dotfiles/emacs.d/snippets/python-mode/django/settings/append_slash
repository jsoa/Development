# When set to True, if the request URL does not match any of the patterns in
# the URLconf and it doesn't end in a slash, an HTTP redirect is issued to the
# same URL with a slash appended. Note that the redirect may cause any data
# submitted in a POST request to be lost.
#
# The APPEND_SLASH setting is only used if CommonMiddleware is installed
