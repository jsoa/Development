# A tuple of strings representing allowed prefixes for the {% ssi %} template
# tag. This is a security measure, so that template authors can't access
# files that they shouldn't be accessing.
#
# For example, if ALLOWED_INCLUDE_ROOTS is ('/home/html', '/var/www'), then
# {% ssi /home/html/foo.txt %} would work, but {% ssi /etc/passwd %} wouldn't.
