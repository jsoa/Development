# A boolean that turns on/off template debug mode. If this is True, the fancy
# error page will display a detailed report for any exception raised during
# template rendering. This report contains the relevant snippet of the
# template, with the appropriate line highlighted.
#
# Note that Django only displays fancy error pages if DEBUG is True, so
# you'll want to set that to take advantage of this setting.
